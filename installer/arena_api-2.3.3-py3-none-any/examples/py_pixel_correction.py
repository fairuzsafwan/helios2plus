Pixel Correction
    This example introduces the basics of pixel correction. 
    A single arbitrary pixel is chosen and added to the device's 
    pixel correction list. These changes are then saved to the 
    camera before being removed.

Pixel values
    This example does not search for pixels to correct, 
    but instead just uses arbitrary pixels to demonstrate 
    what would be done if a bad pixel were found.
